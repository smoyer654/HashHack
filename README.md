# HashHack
Hash Hacking Haven for Hacking-Having Hooligans


This Python project goes through a demonstration of how hashes work, the most common hashing methods, and how they are broken via brute force attacks. 


NOTE: The .py files does not work, you need to open it though IDLE. For some reason, it quits when opening the "common_passwords" file, if anyone knows why let me know.
